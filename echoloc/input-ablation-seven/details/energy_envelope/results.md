# HSSD acoustic pilot: same-bank results

Exploratory 3-scene comparison; vision116-scene training vs acoustic12. No test fitting.

## Observed results and failure analysis

- E + N · 동일한 frozen dense test bank. Best는 test를 열기 전에 val loss로 선택했습니다.

## Failure interpretation

- Top-K exclusion: the visual proposal pool has no candidate within1m; acoustics cannot repair this pool.
- Acoustic selection failure: Top-K includes a candidate within1m but the reranker chooses another location.
- Yaw-only failure: location within1m, heading outside30deg. The primary top-K rule retains visual heading.
- Geometry QA flags are existing review signals, not a confirmed cause. Inspect RGB/map/depth together.
- Pose-clustered paired CIs cover only these exploratory scenes, not unseen-scene generalization.
